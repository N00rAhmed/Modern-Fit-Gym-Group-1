### Problem statement 
Using a paper-based system to manage a gym would result in problems such as inaccurate data, difficulty with membership such as membership paying, communication breakdowns and security vulnerabilities. Memberships would be hard to keep track of as trying to track a member’s history with the gym as well as their payment plan could easily get lost or destroyed as it is on paper. False data could easily be added in which would result in a breach of data and a security risk; with no way of knowing where this breach came from. Miscommunication between a trainer and member would lead to a problem with the payment plan, resulting in either overpaying or underpaying on the member’s side.

### Project Vision
